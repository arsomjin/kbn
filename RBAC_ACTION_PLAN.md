# RBAC INTEGRATION ACTION PLAN

**Deadline**: OVERDUE - Deliver ASAP
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## 🎯 USER'S REQUIREMENTS (EXACT ORDER)

1. ✅ **Apply new RBAC to app flow**
2. ✅ **Modify ApprovalStatus.js to align with new RBAC** - Direct RBAC structure reading
3. ✅ **Modify PermissionManagement to align with new RBAC** - Direct RBAC structure updates
4. ✅ **Create RBAC switching tool for testing** - Available at /dev/rbac-tester
5. ⏳ **Integrate RBAC into all 80+ remaining components** - CURRENT TASK
6. ⏳ **Wire real data to every dashboard pages**

## 🚫 NO MORE DOCUMENTS

- Stop creating showcase/demo documents
- Stop document explosion
- Focus on actual implementation only

## ✅ WORKING USER FLOW (KEEP INTACT)

```
New Users → province/department/branch → ApprovalStatus.js → approval
Existing Users → employeeCode/name → map employee → ApprovalStatus.js → approval
```

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK: ApprovalStatus.js alignment

Need to check what RBAC fields ApprovalStatus.js expects vs what new RBAC provides.

## NOTES

- User's ApprovalStatus.js works perfectly - only align with new RBAC structure
- Don't change the user flow
- Don't create complex migration systems
- Use existing utilities only
