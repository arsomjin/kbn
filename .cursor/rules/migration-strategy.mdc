- Preserve all functionality and business logic during migration.
- Improve code where reasonable but do not remove features.
- Always register new modules in routing, navigation, and menus if applicable.
- Search existing files, components, functions, utilities, etc. in src folder before creating a new one.
- Reuse shared utilities and hooks.
