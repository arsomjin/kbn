# Login Loading Issue - Debug Notes

## Problem

Users were getting stuck at the loading screen after login with the message "กำลังโหลดข้อมูลบทบาทผู้ใช้..." (Loading user role data...)

## Root Cause

The `usePermissions` hook was not properly initializing user RBAC data on first login, causing `userRole` to remain `null` indefinitely.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Migration Logic in `usePermissions.js`

- Added comprehensive debug logging to track migration process
- Fixed the migration logic to handle cases where users have no existing RBAC data
- Added fallback mechanism for users without legacy permissions
- Updated dependency array to include `currentUserRBAC?.role` to trigger re-evaluation

### 2. Timeout Mechanism in `EnhancedRoleBasedDashboard.js`

- Added 10-second timeout for loading state
- Created user-friendly error message with options to:
  - Force load with fallback role (STAFF)
  - Refresh the page
- Imported `Button` component from antd

### 3. Debug Logging

- Added comprehensive console logging to track:
  - Migration process step-by-step
  - RBAC data application
  - Dashboard component rendering
  - Role assignment

## Key Changes

### `src/hooks/usePermissions.js`

- Enhanced `useEffect` with better debug logging
- Added fallback RBAC creation for users without existing data
- Fixed dependency array to properly trigger re-runs

### `src/Modules/Overview/components/EnhancedRoleBasedDashboard.js`

- Added timeout mechanism with user-friendly fallback
- Enhanced debug logging
- Added Button import from antd

## Verification

1. Debug logs will show the migration process in browser console
2. Users should no longer get stuck at loading screen
3. After 10 seconds, users get option to proceed or refresh

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding user onboarding flow for first-time users
- Implement better error handling for RBAC initialization
- Add user role assignment interface for administrators
