## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Animation Optimization:**

```css
/* BEFORE: Discontinuous panning - jumps back to start */
animation: gentleBackgroundShift 40s linear infinite;
/* 0% → 100% → jump back to 0% */

/* AFTER: Smooth bidirectional panning - seamless */
animation: gentleBackgroundShift 40s ease-in-out infinite;
/* 0% → 50% → 100% → smooth back-and-forth */
```

### **Blur Optimization:**

```css
/* BEFORE: Heavy blur effects */
backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%) contrast(115%);

/* AFTER: Optimized blur effects */
backdrop-filter: blur(5px) saturate(130%) contrast(105%);
/* 75% reduction in blur intensity */
```
