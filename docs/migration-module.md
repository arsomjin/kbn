# üîÅ Module Migration Prompt Template

## üìù Description

> üîó This migration must follow all architectural and coding standards defined in `ai-context.md`.  
> Migrate a legacy JavaScript module to the new **Vite-based JavaScript project architecture** while **preserving all original components, logic, and functionality**. Improvements (modernization, performance, maintainability) are welcome ‚Äî but **feature parity is required**.

## üì¶ Source Module

Replace this with the legacy module path:  
`<LEGACY_MODULE_URL_OR_PATH>`

## üìÇ Target Path

New module should be placed under:  
`src/modules/<module-name>` (lowercase)

## ‚úÖ Migration Checklist

- [ ] Maintain **exact component structure and count** ‚Äî do not remove or merge unless functionally justified
- [ ] **Preserve all functionalities and logic** ‚Äî no simplifications or removals
- [ ] Apply responsive design using **Ant Design + Tailwind CSS**
- [ ] Integrate **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** as applicable
- [ ] Filter or restrict data access using relevant business context (e.g., `provinceId`, `role`, `branch`)
- [ ] Replace all `Date`/`moment` usages with **dayjs**
- [ ] Migrate all strings to **i18next**, using a dedicated namespace (e.g., `<module>.json`)
- [ ] Refactor or modernize **outdated patterns or broken dependencies**
- [ ] Ensure **dark mode compatibility**
- [ ] Avoid code duplication by reusing shared **utilities, components, and hooks**
- [ ] Register the module's **routes**, **navigation entries**, and **sidebar/menu items** appropriately using the project's routing and menu systems
- [ ] Update **Firebase logic and structure** to match the new Vite project‚Äôs Firebase structure, modular SDK, and best practices
- [ ] Make all components responsive for all devices using the `useResponsive` hook
- [ ] Apply theme and styles according to the app's theme and style guidelines
- [ ] Replace all message components with implementations using the `useModal` hook

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Enforcement Notes

- ‚úÖ The **number of components and helpers should match** the original unless justified
- ‚úÖ All **features, forms, logic, and interactivity** must behave identically unless explicitly improved
- ‚úÖ Any removed, merged, or restructured elements must be clearly explained (via code comments or PR notes)
- ‚úÖ **You may refactor**, but behavior must remain **identical unless clearly improved**.
- ‚úÖ Scan for existing shared logic and avoid re-creating what already exists.
- ‚úÖ Ensure the module is correctly integrated into the app‚Äôs **navigation**, **routes**, and **menus** (e.g., sidebar, tabs, breadcrumbs)
  üîß When migrating Firebase-related logic, ensure it aligns with the latest Firebase architecture and implementation used in the new project, including version differences, modular SDK usage, Firestore rules structure, and auth/session handling.

## üìå Usage Instructions (For AI Agent)

Replace placeholders:

- `<LEGACY_MODULE_URL_OR_PATH>` with the actual legacy source (e.g., GitHub URL)
- `<module-name>` with the new module folder name
- Add business-specific filters (e.g., `branchId`, `customerGroup`, etc.)
- After completing migration, run the appropriate linter and formatter to ensure code quality (e.g., `pnpm lint --fix` and `pnpm format`)
- If a required component or file is missing, first search within the project directory. If still not found, check in `temp-source/src` before generating a new one.
- Preserve all existing **functionalities and logic** ‚Äî they must remain intact after migration.
- If an existing component can be **enhanced or improved**, apply the enhancement.
- If encountering a **missing dependency**, consult the `ai-context.md` guidelines before installing it.
- Skip already imported files to avoid duplication.
- Do not interrupt the migration process to ask about Linter errors, missing modules, missing components, or missing dependencies ‚Äî skip and proceed until migration is complete.
- If Firebase integration is present, adapt all Firestore, Auth, and related logic to align with the new Vite project‚Äôs Firebase structure
- Do not use `useContext(FirebaseContext)` ‚Äî instead, use direct modular imports from the Firebase SDK (e.g., `getFirestore(app)`, `getAuth(app)`).
- Convert all non-absolute import paths (e.g., `../../utils`) to project-root-based absolute paths (e.g., `utils`)
- Use **Yarn** for all package management tasks ‚Äî do not use `npm`.
- Use **dayjs** unless a third-party library mandates `luxon`.
- Use all message components from useModal hook.
- Ensure all components are responsive across devices by applying the `useResponsive` hook
- Follow the app-wide theme and style guidelines when applying styles
- Replace all existing message components with implementations using the `useModal` hook
- This migration targets a **JavaScript-based Vite project** (not TypeScript).
