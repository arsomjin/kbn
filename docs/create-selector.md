Best Practices for small dataset

function App() {
  return (
    <BranchProvider>
      <DepartmentProvider>
        <EmployeeProvider>
          {/* Your app components */}
        </EmployeeProvider>
      </DepartmentProvider>
    </BranchProvider>
  );
}

Best Practices for large dataset
Always implement pagination or virtual scrolling for large datasets
Use debounced search to reduce database queries
Cache frequently used data
Consider implementing infinite scroll for better UX
Add loading states and error handling
Use indices in Firestore for better query performance
