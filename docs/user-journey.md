## 2. Step-by-Step User Journeys

### üë§ New User (Pending Approval)
1. **Authentication:** User signs in via Firebase (email/password, Google, or phone).
2. **Profile Completion Check:**
   - System checks if user has completed their profile information.
   - If profile is incomplete, user is redirected to the Complete Profile page.
   - User selects their type (Employee or Visitor) and fills in required information.
   - System saves profile with role set to `PENDING`.
3. **Role Check:** System checks for assigned role in Firestore.
4. **Pending State:**
   - If role is `PENDING`, user is redirected to the Pending page.
   - A real-time Firestore listener monitors for role assignment.
   - User sees a clear message: _"Waiting for admin approval"_.
5. **Automatic Progression:**
   - Once an admin assigns a role, the listener triggers an automatic redirect to the appropriate landing page (no manual refresh required).

### üëë Privileged User (Admin/Manager)
1. **Authentication:** User logs in.
2. **Profile Check:**
   - System verifies profile completion.
3. **Role & Privilege Check:**
   - System confirms assigned role and checks privilege level (e.g., ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN).
4. **Access Granted:**
   - User is redirected to the Overview page.
   - Administrative dashboard and controls are available.
   - Real-time updates ensure immediate access changes if privileges are updated.

### üôç Standard User
1. **Authentication:** User logs in.
2. **Profile Check:**
   - System verifies profile completion.
3. **Role & Privilege Check:**
   - System confirms assigned role and checks for standard permissions.
4. **Access Granted:**
   - User is redirected to the User Dashboard.
   - Only features relevant to standard users are displayed.
   - Real-time updates ensure access is adjusted if role changes.

## 3. Real-Time Experience Highlights

- **Instant Feedback:** Users are always shown their current access state, with no need to refresh.
- **Automatic Redirection:** Role or privilege changes (e.g., admin approval) trigger immediate navigation to the correct page.
- **Clear Communication:** Pending users receive clear, actionable feedback about their status.
- **Security:** Users never see unauthorized content, even briefly, due to real-time privilege checks.
- **Adaptive Forms:** The profile completion form changes based on user type selection (Employee/Visitor).
- **Personalized Experience:** Profile photos and display names are used to create a personalized greeting when available.
